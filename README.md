# Hey, I’m Godellena 👋🏽✨  
*(a.k.a. Ellena — building, learning, and shipping one repo at a time)*

I’m a **web developer** with a soft spot for clean code, bold ideas, and projects that actually *do something*.  
Currently leveling up my skills, breaking things (on purpose), fixing them, and documenting the glow-up.

## 🌱 About Me
- 💻 Aspiring **Web Developer**
- 🧠 Obsessed with understanding *how* things work, not just making them work
- 🚀 Interested in building real-world, impactful projects
- 🌍 From Ghana 🇬🇭 | Global mindset
- 🧩 I like Git when it behaves and love it when it doesn’t (because learning)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (and growing)
**Languages & Tools I Work With:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Git & GitHub  
- Tailwind CSS (still learning😌) 
- Basic backend & databases (learning in progress 👀)

**Currently Learning / Exploring:**
- Deeper JavaScript patterns
- Better Git workflows (branches, merges, the whole saga)
- Writing cleaner, more readable code

---

## ✨ What I Care About
- Writing code that’s **understandable**, not just clever  
- Learning in public (mistakes included)
- Building a strong foundation before chasing hype
- Growth > perfection

## 📌 Fun Facts
- I ask *a lot* of questions (that’s how you get good)

- I’m playing the long game — consistency over shortcuts
